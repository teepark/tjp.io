Hi, I'm Travis! I'm 36 and live in northern California.

I love my faith, family, home, and job. I'm also very much into photography, surfing, and reading books. With all the social upheaval going on in June and July 2020 I've devoted myself to better understanding the injustices in our society. So I'll probably write about those things.

This is about my dozenth attempt at sticking with a personal website though, so let's see how it goes!
